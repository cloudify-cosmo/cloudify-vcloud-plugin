# Tosca VCloud Plugin Compatibility Project

The Cloudify VCloud Plugin is a replacement for the Tosca VCloud Plugin. However, it is not backward compatible. The new plugin uses modern Cloudify topology and design. In order for users olf the old Tosca VCloud Plugin to continue to use their old blueprints on Python 3 managers, we have limited compatibility modules.
